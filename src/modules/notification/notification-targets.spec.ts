/**
 * Every notification is a promise that tapping it goes somewhere useful. This
 * spec keeps that promise honest by resolving every builder's `data.screen`
 * (+ `entityId`) into the URL the clients actually navigate to, and matching
 * it against the routes those apps actually declare.
 *
 * It exists because three separate bugs shipped through the same blind spot:
 *   - `/coaching/payments/:id` was sent a payment id; no such route (404).
 *   - `/coaching/clients/:id` was sent a workout-log id; the route matches but
 *     the page loads a *client*, so it found nothing.
 *   - the mobile deep-link map was built from screens that only appear in test
 *     fixtures, and missed `user/plans` entirely.
 *
 * The route lists below are copied from the two Angular apps (a separate repo).
 * When a route moves there, this fails — which is the point: the notification
 * is the thing that breaks, and it breaks silently otherwise.
