/**
 * Swagger documentation for the messaging module.
 *
 * Conventions matched here:
 *   - Every endpoint that needs auth declares `auth: true` so the
 *     "Authorize" button surfaces the bearer-token form.
 *   - Silent-drop endpoints (POST /messaging/messages when blocked)
 *     do NOT surface a separate 403 example — the response shape is
 *     identical to a successful send by design. Documented in the
 *     description instead so the FE knows what to do with `delivered:
 *     false`.
 *   - Admin endpoints note the required roles in the description and
 *     include 403 for non-admin callers.
