  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <p>BeeActive (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;) respects your privacy. This policy describes what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

  <h2>1. Data we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data:</strong> When you register or sign in (including via Google or Facebook), we store your email, name, and profile information you provide or that we receive from the provider (e.g. profile picture).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> We may collect information about how you use the app (e.g. sessions, groups, activity) to provide and improve the service.</li>
    <li><strong>Device &amp; log data:</strong> We may collect IP address, browser/device type, and similar technical data for security and operation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How we use your data</h2>
  <p>We use your data to provide the BeeActive service (e.g. account management, groups, sessions, notifications), to communicate with you, to improve the app, and to comply with the law.</p>

  <h2>3. Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your data. We may share data with service providers that help us run the app (e.g. hosting, email). If you sign in with Google or Facebook, their use of data is governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>4. Security and retention</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your data. We retain it for as long as your account is active or as needed for legal or operational purposes.</p>

  <h2>5. Your rights</h2>
  <p>You can access and update your profile in the app. You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time (see <a href="#user-data-deletion">User data deletion</a> below).</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>For privacy questions or requests, contact us at <strong>support@beeactive.fit</strong> (replace with your real support or contact email).</p>

  <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ddd;" />

  <h1 id="user-data-deletion">User data deletion</h1>
  <p>You can request deletion of your BeeActive account and the data we hold about you at any time.</p>

  <h2>How to request deletion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>In the app:</strong> Use the account or settings section and choose &quot;Delete account&quot; or &quot;Request data deletion&quot;, if available.</li>
    <li><strong>By email:</strong> Send an email to <strong>support@beeactive.fit</strong> (replace with your real support email). Include the email address associated with your BeeActive account. We will process your request and confirm once your account and data have been deleted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What we delete</h2>
  <p>After we verify your identity, we will delete your account and the personal data we store (profile, email, activity data, etc.). Some data may be retained where required by law (e.g. for legal or accounting purposes) or in anonymised form.</p>

  <h2>Third-party sign-in (Google / Facebook)</h2>
  <p>If you signed up using Google or Facebook, we will remove the link between your BeeActive account and that provider and delete your BeeActive data as above. To revoke BeeActive’s access to your Google or Facebook account, use the security or connected-apps settings in your Google or Facebook account.</p>
